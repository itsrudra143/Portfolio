# 💼 Personal Portfolio

Welcome to my personal portfolio website — a simple, responsive site built using only **HTML and CSS**.

## ✨ About the Project

This portfolio was crafted as a digital reflection of who I am — my journey, my work, and my passion for creating.  
From showcasing projects to sharing a little about myself, this site is a stepping stone into my world as a developer.

It’s minimal, elegant, and clean — just how a portfolio should be.

Whether you're here to explore my work or just passing through, thank you for visiting!
